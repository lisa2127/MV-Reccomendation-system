# MV-Recommendation-system

Recommender systems encompass a class of techniques and algorithms that can suggest “relevant” items to users. They predict future behavior based on past data through a multitude of techniques including matrix factorization.
Machine learning algorithms in recommender systems typically fit into two categories: content-based systems and collaborative filtering systems. 
The below model uses TMDB 5000 movies dataset and does content based filtering ,based on the similariites of contents and tags.
